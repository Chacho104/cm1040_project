        <h3>Dot-com Boom</h3>
        <span>1995 - 2004</span>
      </div>
      <p class="line-clamp">The Dot-com Boom era marked the beginning of the commercial internet age, characterized by rapid growth, speculation, and the establishment of foundational technologies that would support future digital innovations (Kroll et al., 2010). This period saw the transformation of the internet from an academic and military network into a global commercial platform that would revolutionize business, communication, and daily life. During this era, entrepreneurs and investors rushed to capitalize on the potential of the World Wide Web, leading to both spectacular successes and dramatic failures. The period was defined by the belief that traditional business models were obsolete and that internet-based companies could achieve rapid growth and profitability. While the dot-com bubble eventually burst in 2000, the technological infrastructure and digital literacy developed during this time laid the groundwork for all subsequent internet innovations.</p>

        <span>2005 - 2014</span>
      </div>
      <p class="line-clamp">The Social Media &amp; Mobile Revolution era fundamentally transformed how people connect, share information, and access digital services, as it marked the transition from static web pages to dynamic, user-generated content platforms and from desktop-bound internet access to ubiquitous mobile connectivity. This era was characterized by the democratization of content creation and the emergence of social networks as primary communication channels. The combination of improved mobile technology and social platforms created new forms of digital interaction that blurred the lines between online and offline experiences. The period established social media as a dominant force in communications, marketing, entertainment, and even political discourse.</p>

        <span>2015 - Present</span>
      </div>
      <p class="line-clamp">Streaming, AI, &amp; 5G is characterized by the maturation of digital platforms and the emergence of artificial intelligence as a transformative force. This period has seen the convergence of high-speed connectivity, sophisticated algorithms, and massive datasets to create increasingly personalized and intelligent digital experiences. This era is distinguished by the shift from discrete digital tools to integrated ecosystems that anticipate user needs and adapt to individual preferences. The combination of streaming services, AI-powered recommendations, and ubiquitous connectivity has created a seamless digital environment that extends across devices and platforms.</p>

        <h3>Pioneers of the Early Web</h3>
        <span>1995 - 2004</span>
      </div>
      <p class="line-clamp">The first era of the digital revolution in the USA was characterized by the transformation of the internet from an academic and military network into a global commercial platform that would revolutionize business, communication, and daily life. The innovators in this era had to take bold steps and venture into uncharted waters. From the founding of Google to the launch and growth of Amazon, this era set the foundation for the transformation of the world into a global village, where human interactions: business, commerce, social, and educational, know no boundaries.</p>

        <span>2005 - 2014</span>
      </div>
      <p class="line-clamp">The second era of digital innovation was characterized by the rise of social networking platforms and the transformation of mobile devices from simple communication tools into powerful computing platforms. The innovators of this period understood that technology&#39;s greatest value lay not just in processing information, but in connecting people and enabling new forms of human interaction.</p>

        <h3>Modern Shapers</h3>
        <span>2015 - Present</span>
      </div>
      <p class="line-clamp">The current era of technology leadership is defined by individuals who are navigating the integration of artificial intelligence, sustainable technology, and global connectivity challenges. These modern shapers are building on the platforms and infrastructure created in previous eras while addressing new challenges related to AI ethics, climate change, and global inequality. Unlike earlier eras focused primarily on connecting people and digitizing existing processes, today&#39;s leaders are working to create intelligent systems that can augment human capabilities and solve complex global problems. Their work spans from advancing artificial intelligence to developing sustainable transportation and energy systems. This generation of leaders also faces unprecedented scrutiny regarding the social impact of their technologies, leading to new approaches to corporate responsibility, ethical AI development, and stakeholder engagement. Their decisions today will largely determine how technology serves humanity in the coming decades.</p>
