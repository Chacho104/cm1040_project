        <h3>Dot-com Boom</h3>
        <span>1995 - 2004</span>
      </div>
      <p class="line-clamp">The Dot-com Boom era marked the beginning of the commercial internet age, characterized by rapid growth, speculation, and the establishment of foundational technologies that would support future digital innovations (Kroll et al., 2010). This period saw the transformation of the internet from an academic and military network into a global commercial platform that would revolutionize business, communication, and daily life. During this era, entrepreneurs and investors rushed to capitalize on the potential of the World Wide Web, leading to both spectacular successes and dramatic failures. The period was defined by the belief that traditional business models were obsolete and that internet-based companies could achieve rapid growth and profitability. While the dot-com bubble eventually burst in 2000, the technological infrastructure and digital literacy developed during this time laid the groundwork for all subsequent internet innovations.</p>

        <h3>Social Media &amp; Mobile</h3>
        <span>2005 - 2014</span>
      </div>
      <p class="line-clamp">The Social Media &amp; Mobile Revolution era fundamentally transformed how people connect, share information, and access digital services, as it marked the transition from static web pages to dynamic, user-generated content platforms and from desktop-bound internet access to ubiquitous mobile connectivity. This era was characterized by the democratization of content creation and the emergence of social networks as primary communication channels. The combination of improved mobile technology and social platforms created new forms of digital interaction that blurred the lines between online and offline experiences. The period established social media as a dominant force in communications, marketing, entertainment, and even political discourse.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="line-clamp">Streaming, AI, &amp; 5G is characterized by the maturation of digital platforms and the emergence of artificial intelligence as a transformative force. This period has seen the convergence of high-speed connectivity, sophisticated algorithms, and massive datasets to create increasingly personalized and intelligent digital experiences. This era is distinguished by the shift from discrete digital tools to integrated ecosystems that anticipate user needs and adapt to individual preferences. The combination of streaming services, AI-powered recommendations, and ubiquitous connectivity has created a seamless digital environment that extends across devices and platforms.</p>
