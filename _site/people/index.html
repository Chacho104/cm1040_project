          <h3>Larry Page &amp; Sergey Brin</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Larry Page (born March 26, 1973, in Michigan, USA) and Sergey Brin (born August 21, 1973, in Moscow, Russia) are the co-founders of Google.

Together, while PhD students at Stanford in the mid-1990s, they developed a research project that evolved into Google, officially founded in 1998. Both went on to become leaders of Google and later Alphabet Inc., before stepping back from executive roles in 2019, though they remain influential as board members and major shareholders.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content-text">
      <p>Page and Brin’s most significant contribution was the development of the PageRank algorithm, which revolutionized web search by analyzing the link structure of the internet to determine the relevance and authority of web pages. This innovation made Google&#39;s search results significantly more accurate than competitors who relied primarily on keyword matching. Their work transformed Google from a Stanford research project into the world&#39;s dominant search engine and advertising platform.
